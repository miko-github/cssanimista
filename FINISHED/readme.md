# CSSANIMISTA jQuery Plugin

>(***need to developing and fixing!***)

## what is CSS-ANIMISTA

cssanimista is a ***css animation library*** and this library not have complete file to download them, but for using it
you *would* liking any animation you need them to use, in next, that animation was sended to a list, then you can
download css file, wow!

## what is problem if we can download from that website

so, you can **download only keyframe file** and not css selectors(*like class name for animation*), so, **how you can
use them?** <br />
you maybe think "i create css selector for it!", but i say: 'why?' <br />
i think make jQuery plugin for this library and you can use this plugin with **ANY CSS KEYFRAME FILE LIBRARY**, how?
<br />

## how it work? what it do

this plugin can add to you webpages easier and faster css animation name and jQuery event, how? <br />
this can work with any css library! :)
<br />
you can add event, use infinite animation, use click in and out & hover in and out, or, can use train mode, chain mode,
random mode of animations!!! how it impossible

## NOTE
